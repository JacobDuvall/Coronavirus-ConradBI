Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package will allow you to get zip code information. The data used in this
        package is retrieved from
        http://pablotron.org/files/zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.zip
        
        pyzipcode uses a local sqlite database to run. You can replace it with your own
        other storage mechanism with a little effort.
        
        Here is some basic usage..
        
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> zipcode = zcdb[54115]
        	>>> zipcode.zip
        	u'54115'
        	>>> zipcode.city
        	u'De Pere'
        	>>> zipcode.state
        	u'WI'
        	>>> zipcode.longitude
        	-88.078959999999995
        	>>> zipcode.latitude
        	44.42042
        	>>> zipcode.timezone
        	-6
        
        
        Search zip codes...
        
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> len(zcdb.find_zip(city="Oshkosh"))
        	7
        
        
        Get a list of zipcodes around a radius of a zipcode
        
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> [z.zip for z in zcdb.get_zipcodes_around_radius('54901', 10)]
        	[u'54901', u'54902', u'54903', u'54904', u'54906', u'54927', u'54952', u'54956', u'54957', u'54979', u'54985']
        
        
        ChangeLog
        =========
        
        2.0.0 (2020-04-07)
        ------------------
        
        - updated to work with py3
          [David Schneider]
        
        1.0 (2016-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix import code so that it is not run when the module is imported (for
          example, when building Sphinx API Documentation).
        * Rename the import.py module to import_zipcode.py because `import` is a
          reserved Python keyword.
        * Document the import_zipcode module.

        * updated to use maxmind database http://www.maxmind.com/app/postalcode
        
        * now also keeps timezone and dst values
        
        * longitude and latitude is now contains negative numbers
        
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        * use strings instead of integer for storing zip codes since zip codes can start
          with a Zero.
        
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        * catch sqlite db file reading errors and keep trying in case
          another process is trying to access the file at the same time.
        
        
        0.1
